<h2 id="overview">Overview:</h2>
<p>Using react as a front-end framework, building a ui, users can input data about students or employees with file attachments, sending that stuff to the back-end via REST APIs in JSON format. The back-end will use Django and Django REST framework in order to deal with those data, storing and retreiving them. building apps for students and employees, each with its models, their views will be responsable for each feature related to that model like adding student stuff or updating them, those views will take the data from the APIs and - after dealing with’em - responding with suitable data back. the system will use token-based authentication - maybe JWT - and postgresql database - cause sqlite won’t fil in that place - and there’ll be no signup cause the admin user will be able to add, update or delete users.</p>
